Helm DEPLOY!!
It only needs the helm package and the values file.
The most polished and tested version of all three here.
To deploy wiremock use:



helm install wiremock wiremock-chart-0.1.0.tgz -f values.yaml --set fullnameOverride=wiremock -n wiremock --create-namespace



Args can be used to set a proxy and access different settings of wiremock...
Set the appropriate storageClass
