Helm DEPLOY!!
It only needs the helm package and the values file.
The most polished and tested version of all three here.
To deploy wiremock use:

helm install wiremock wiremock-chart-0.1.0.tgz -f values.yaml --set fullnameOverride=wiremock -n wiremock --create-namespace

By default.. it is configured to accept args in order to record mappings and be a partial proxy replacement
Update the image name, pull policy accordingly,
Set the appropriate image name and the storageClass 

liveness and probin configuration is set to hit the admin endpoint for now.
