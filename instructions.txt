There are three sections to this..
##docker-compose
Wiremock is deployed in docker at port 8080 and then port forwarded. It uses the files and mappings folders.
Can be used at localhost:8080

docker-compose up

##wiremock.yaml
Creates two pvc using a storageclassName.. I used RWX but RWO would also work
__files and mappings folders now exist inside the containers so they can only be used via REST APIs.

kubectl apply -f wiremock.yaml

Setup ingress using the ingresscontroller.yaml and ingress.yaml

kubectl apply -f ingresscontroller.yaml
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

Update the hostpath and set it to the appropriate Node IP (one with ingress controller) in /etc/hosts

##values.yaml
Helm DEPLOY!!
It only needs the helm package and the values file.
The most polished and tested version of all three here.
To deploy wiremock use:

helm install wiremock wiremock-chart-0.1.0.tgz -f values.yaml --set fullnameOverride=wiremock -n wiremock --create-namespace

By default.. it is configured to accept args in order to record mappings and be a partial proxy replacement
Update the image name, pull policy accordingly,
Set the appropriate image name and the storageClass 

liveness and probin configuration is set to hit the admin endpoint for now.
